# Babel Playground

This is a sample repository for getting basic hands on experience with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

## Description
In old browsers with limited ES 2015 support all examples from src folder result in errors. However, using the Babel transpiled JS from dist folder everything works. 

[ES 2015 browser compatibility](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)

[BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com)

## Usage
**1. npm install**

**2. npm run build**

**3. npm test** (to run tests)

**src/index.html** - opened in older browsers that do not support ES 2015 will cause errors
**dist/index.html** - opened in older browsers that do not support ES 2015 will work OK
