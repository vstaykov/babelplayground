# Babel Playground

This is a sample repository for getting basic hands on experience with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

## Description
In old browsers with limited ES 2015 support all examples from src folder result in errors. However, using the Babel transpiled JS from dist folder everything works. 

[ES 2015 browser compatibility] (https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)
